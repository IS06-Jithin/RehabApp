Semantics of csv file columns and values
========================================
video_id -- id of the video file
repetition_number -- number of repetition within given video
exercise_id -- id of the exercise; description of exercises is provided on the main dataset page on Zenodo
person_id -- id of exercising person
first_frame -- number of the first frame of the repetition
last_frame -- number of the last frame of the repetition
cam17_orientation -- orientation of exercising person towards camera17, possible values are 'front', 'half-profile' and 'profile'; as camera18 was placed orthogonally to camera17, this also implies orientation of the person towards camera18
  cam17 orientation -> cam18 orientation
  front -> side
  half-profile -> half-profile
  side -> front
mocap_erroneous -- indication whether there is an error in mocap data (some markers not correctly detected)
exercise_subtype -- for some exercises, we distinguish between right- and left-sided execution of the exercise
lights_on -- indicates whether lights were switched on
extra_person_in_cam17 -- indication whether extra persons or their parts appear in the camera17 recording; numerical values with the following semantics
  0: no extra person visible
  1: negligible part of extra person visible (e.g., part of hand in the edge of frame for a short period)
  2: noticable part of extra person visible (such as whole arm for more than a few frames)
  3: large part of extra person visible
extra_person_in_cam18 -- indication whether extra persons or their parts appear in the camera17 recording; semantics same as above
correctness -- indication whether given exercise repetition was performed correctly (1) or not (0)
